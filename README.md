## Summary
I set out to answer what features contributed the most to the survival rate of passengers in the titanic dataset.  I set out to answer the following questions: Did age and gender contribute significantly to the survival rate of passengers?  Did socioeconomic features contribute significantly to the survival rate?  Did family size contribute significantly to the survival rate?

I chose a bar chart for the first visualization to show the distribution of the passengers and to allow a viwer to quickly distinguish between who survived and if they were male or female.  The interaction with the first visualization was designed to illuminate that age and gender had a significant impact on the depedent variable of survival.

I chose a pseudo-bar chart for my second visualization to illuminate how the socioeconomic features impacted survival.  I chose green and red colors to clearly communicate to the viewer the distinction that socioeconomic features of the passengers had on survival.

The third visualization was the most difficult to communicate visually how family size contributed to survival rate because all of the features involved were discrete variables.  However, treating family size as a continuous variable aided in visualizing that the passengers with very large families had a higher probablility of not surviving the sink.

After I received feedback, I made a few adjustments to the first and third visualization.  The first visualization is now easier to visualize the ratio of survival/non-survival by gender.  The third generation is now in a palette of shades of red to avoid confusing a reader by using the same colors as the first two visualizations.  I also made a few tweaks to the text in the storyboards.

## Feedback
1) Try to make your comparison obvious. On the first graph, you have to use the radio buttons to see survived and not survived. This does not make the comparison obvious. Instead, you can use stacked bars or just use survival rate = survived/total.

2) Try to make your graphs intuitive. Maybe this is a matter of personal taste, but since you use blue as your primary color, I thought that on the second chart the blue were the survivors. Again this is probably a matter of personal taste.
